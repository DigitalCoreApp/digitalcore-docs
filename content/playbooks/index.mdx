# Playbooks in DigitalCore

## What Are Playbooks?

### Operational Response Guides for Service Management

Playbooks are structured response guides for common service management challenges. Each playbook addresses a specific situation — declining margins, capacity imbalance, client churn risk, scope creep — and provides a step-by-step framework for diagnosis and response.

DigitalCore includes 29 playbooks covering the full range of service economics challenges. Each playbook follows a consistent structure: warning signs, confirmed issue indicators, diagnostic questions, recommended actions, and expected outcomes.

### When to Activate — Warning Signs, Confirmed Issues, Diagnostics

Each playbook defines when to activate it:

- **Warning Signs** — Early indicators that something may be developing (e.g., margin declining for 2 consecutive months)
- **Confirmed Issues** — Definitive evidence the problem exists (e.g., margin below 20% for a quarter)
- **Diagnostics** — Questions to ask and data to examine before deciding on a response

### How Each Playbook Connects to Your Data in DigitalCore

Playbooks reference specific data you track in DigitalCore: finance actuals, KPI results, capacity utilisation, and health scores. When a playbook says "check cost variance," you can go directly to the engagement's finance grid and see the relevant numbers.

## Using Playbooks with the Platform

### How Check-in Data Triggers Playbook Recommendations

As you enter check-in data, DigitalCore's health scoring and AI capabilities can identify situations that match playbook activation criteria. The AI assistant can recommend relevant playbooks based on your engagement's current performance.

### Connecting Playbook Actions to Scenarios

Many playbooks recommend modelling the response before implementing it. Use [Scenario Intelligence](/docs/guides/scenarios) to create what-if models of the playbook's recommended actions — test the financial impact of a rate review, a staffing change, or a service redesign before committing.

### Tracking Playbook Outcomes in Your Dashboard

After implementing a playbook's recommendations, track the results through your regular check-in process. Compare pre-intervention and post-intervention metrics to measure effectiveness.
