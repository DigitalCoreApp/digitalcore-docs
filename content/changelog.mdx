## February 2026

### New Features

- **AI Narrative Generation (Ollama-powered)** — Executive summaries and period narratives now use on-premise AI for faster, more private text generation with automatic cloud fallback.

- **4-Service Microservice Architecture** — Backend services split into independent containers (MCP, AI, Ingest, Sync) for isolated scaling and deployment.
