## Plans Overview

### Free Tier — Get Started at No Cost

DigitalCore offers a free tier that lets you set up your organisation, configure services and engagements, and begin tracking operational data. The free tier includes limited users and core features — enough to evaluate the platform with real data.

### Paid Plans — More Users, AI Features, and Integrations

Paid plans unlock additional users, AI capabilities (scenario generation, executive summaries, AI assistant), API access for MCP tools, and advanced analytics features.

## Billing Basics

### Monthly vs. Annual Pricing

Paid plans are available with monthly or annual billing. Annual billing offers a discount compared to monthly pricing.

### How Seat-Based Pricing Works

Pricing is based on the number of users (seats) in your organisation. Each user who needs access counts as one seat. Add or remove seats at any time — billing adjusts proportionally.

### Upgrading and Downgrading

Upgrade from the free tier or between paid plans at any time from **Settings → Subscription**. Downgrades take effect at the end of the current billing period.

## Free Trial

### How the Trial Works

New paid subscriptions include a 14-day free trial. During the trial, you have full access to all paid features. No payment is charged until the trial ends.

### What Happens When It Ends

After the trial, your subscription converts to a paid plan automatically if a payment method is on file. If no payment method is provided, your account reverts to the free tier — your data is preserved, but paid features become unavailable.
