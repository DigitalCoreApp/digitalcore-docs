## Authentication

### Email / Password Login

DigitalCore uses email and password authentication. Enter your email and password at the login page to access your account.

### Password Requirements

Passwords must be:

- At least 8 characters
- Include a mix of letters and numbers

Stronger passwords (12+ characters with special characters) are recommended.

## Password Management

### Changing Your Password

Go to **Settings → Security → Change Password**. Enter your current password and choose a new one.

### Reset Password Flow

If you've forgotten your password:

1. Click **Forgot Password** on the login page
2. Enter your email to receive a reset link
3. The link expires after 24 hours
4. Click the link, set a new password, and log in

## Account Security Best Practices

### Use Strong, Unique Passwords

Use a password manager to generate and store a unique password for your DigitalCore account. Don't reuse passwords across services.

### Rotate API Keys Periodically

If you use API keys for MCP or programmatic access, rotate them quarterly. See [API Keys](/docs/mcp-and-integrations/api-keys) for the rotation procedure.

## Data Isolation

### Your Data is Isolated — Other Organisations Cannot See It

DigitalCore enforces strict data isolation at the database level. Every query is filtered by your organisation's identity. Users in one organisation can never see, access, or modify data belonging to another organisation — even at the database level.
