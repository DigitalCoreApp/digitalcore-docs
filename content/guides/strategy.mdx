## The Strategy Workspace

### Cockpit — High-Level Strategic Visibility

The Strategy Cockpit provides strategic-level visibility across your portfolio. It aggregates health scores, financial performance, and capacity utilisation into a single view for leadership.

### OKRs — Objectives and Key Results

Track organisational objectives and link them to operational delivery. Each objective has measurable key results that can be connected to specific engagements.

### AI Initiatives — Tracking AI Adoption

Monitor AI initiative adoption across your organisation — which engagements use AI, what types of AI use cases are deployed, and what economic impact they have.

---

## Setting Up OKRs

### Creating Objectives

Go to **Strategy → OKRs** and create a new objective. Give it a clear description (e.g., "Improve portfolio margin to 35%") and a target date.

### Linking Key Results to Engagements

Add key results to each objective. Key results are measurable outcomes (e.g., "Reduce labour costs by 10% across managed services") that can be linked to specific engagements for operational tracking.

## Managing AI Initiatives

### What Counts as an AI Initiative

An AI initiative is any use of AI within your service delivery — from AI-assisted monitoring and reporting to AI-augmented operations. The AI Use Case Catalog defines your standard initiative types.

### Tracking AI Usage Across Engagements

Assign AI use cases to engagements to track adoption. See which engagements are using AI, what capabilities are deployed, and track associated costs and benefits.
