# Importing Data from Excel/CSV

Bulk import entities and financial data into DigitalCore using Excel or CSV files.

---

## Supported Import Types

### Entity Import

Import core entities in bulk: services, engagements, contracts, partners, and stakeholders. Useful when onboarding an existing portfolio into DigitalCore.

### Financial Data Bulk Import

Import historical financial data (planned and actual values) for existing engagements. Useful for migrating from spreadsheet-based tracking.

### Download a Template

For each import type, download a pre-formatted Excel template from the Bulk Upload page. The template includes all required and optional columns with example data.

## Using the Bulk Upload Page

### Accessing Configuration → Bulk Upload

Navigate to **Configuration → Bulk Upload** from the left sidebar. Select the entity type you want to import.

### Uploading a File

Drag and drop your Excel or CSV file, or click to browse. Supported formats: `.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.csv`.

### Reviewing the Staging Screen

After upload, the data appears in a staging table. Each row is validated against the expected schema. Valid rows are marked green, errors are highlighted in red with explanatory messages.

### Validating and Confirming Import

Review any errors and fix them in the staging table or go back to your original file. Once all rows validate, click **Confirm Import** to write the data.

## Common Issues

### Column Mapping Errors

If column headers in your file don't match the expected names, the staging screen will show mapping warnings. Rename columns to match the template headers.

### Duplicate Detection

The system checks for duplicates based on key fields (e.g., engagement name + service). Duplicates are flagged and can be skipped or updated.

### Validation Error Messages

Common errors include:

- **Missing required fields** — e.g., organisation reference
- **Invalid date formats** — use YYYY-MM-DD
- **Invalid references** — e.g., service name doesn't match an existing service
