# Creating and Evaluating Scenarios

Scenarios let you model "what if" situations and compare different courses of action before committing to a plan change.

## When to Create a Scenario

### Common Triggers

Create a scenario when you identify a potential change or risk:

- **Cost overrun** — Actuals exceeding plan, need to model corrective actions
- **Revenue change** — Customer requesting pricing revision, need to model impact
- **Capacity shift** — Team member leaving or joining, need to model cost effects
- **Contract renewal** — Renegotiating terms, need to compare options

### Choosing the Right Scenario Type

| Type | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| **Reforecast** | Update projections based on recent actuals |
| **Risk Response** | Model mitigation strategies for identified problems |
| **Growth** | Project impact of expansion or new business |
| **Cost Reduction** | Evaluate impact of efficiency measures |

## Option A: AI-Generated Scenarios

### Using "Generate Options" for an Engagement

Navigate to the engagement's scenario section and select **Generate Options**. Describe the situation or goal: "Margins are declining, what options do I have?" The AI analyses the engagement's current data and generates 2-4 distinct scenario variants.

### Reviewing the AI-Suggested Approaches

Each AI-generated scenario comes with:

- A descriptive label (e.g., "Conservative Cost Cut," "Balanced Approach," "Growth Bet")
- The specific drivers applied
- Projected financial impact (revenue, cost, and margin changes)

## Option B: Manual Scenario Creation

### Creating a Blank Scenario

Create a new scenario from the Decisions workspace. Give it a name and description, and select the target engagement(s). The scenario starts with your current plan as the baseline.

### Adding Drivers (Percentage, Absolute, or Fixed Value)

Add drivers to model changes:

- **Percentage**: Revenue +10%, or All Costs −5%
- **Absolute**: +2 FTEs (adds hours and corresponding labour costs)
- **Fixed Value**: Set availability target to 99.9%

Each driver specifies which domain, which items, and what change to apply.

## Evaluating and Refining

### Reading the Impact View

The Impact tab shows the projected effects of all drivers combined: how revenue, costs, margins, KPIs, and capacity would change if the scenario were adopted.

### Adjusting Driver Values

Edit individual drivers to fine-tune the scenario. Increase or decrease percentages, change which items are affected, or add new drivers. The Impact view updates immediately.

### Comparing Multiple Scenarios Side-by-Side

Open the comparison view to place two or more scenarios next to each other. See the key differences: projected margin, capacity requirement, risk factors. This is where you make the decision.

## Committing a Scenario

### What "Commit" Does — Adopting the Plan

Committing a scenario writes its projected values into your live plan. Your old plan values are preserved in the scenario history for reference.

### Undoing a Commit

If you change your mind, reverse the commit. DigitalCore restores the previous plan values and marks the scenario as reverted.

## Checking Accuracy Later

### Comparing Predictions to Actuals

After actuals are recorded for the scenario's period, return to the scenario and check accuracy. How close were the projections to reality? This feedback loop improves your modelling intuition over time.
