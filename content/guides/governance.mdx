## What is the Decisions Workspace?

### Structured Decision-Making for Service Management

The Decisions workspace provides a framework for making and tracking important service management decisions. Instead of decisions living in email threads or meeting notes, they're recorded with full context, options, and outcomes.

### The 4-Step Framework

Every governance case follows four steps:

1. **Situation** — What's happening? What triggered this decision?
2. **Options & Analysis** — What are the alternatives? What does scenario modelling show?
3. **Decision** — What was decided? Who made the call?
4. **Next Steps** — What actions follow? Who's responsible?

## Creating a Governance Case

### Describing the Situation

Create a new governance case from the **Decisions** workspace. Describe the situation: what's happening, why it matters, and what data supports the assessment. Link to specific engagements or services for context.

### Linking to Engagements or Services

Associate the governance case with one or more engagements or services. This enables context-aware analysis and scenario modelling specific to the affected engagements.

## Evaluating Options

### Scenarios as Decision Options

Link scenarios to the governance case. Each scenario represents a potential course of action. The scenario's Impact tab shows the projected financial and operational effects.

### Comparing Scenario Impacts

Use the comparison view to evaluate scenarios side by side. Key metrics: projected margin change, cost delta, capacity requirement, risk level.

## Recording the Decision

### Documenting the Chosen Path

Record which option was selected, who made the decision, and the rationale. This becomes part of the permanent audit trail.

### Accountability and Audit Trail

Every governance case records who created it, who contributed to analysis, and who made the final decision. The timeline tracks all actions and changes.

## Follow-Up

### Next Steps and Action Items

After a decision is recorded, add specific action items with owners and due dates. These appear in the responsible person's attention items on the dashboard.

### Risks and Issues Tracking

Link identified risks and issues to the governance case. Track their status as the decision is implemented.

### Monitoring Progress via Timeline

The engagement timeline shows governance events alongside check-ins, milestones, and other activities. This provides a complete chronological view of what happened and why.
