# Reading the Portfolio Dashboard

The dashboard is your home base in DigitalCore — a personalised view of what needs attention, portfolio health, and quick actions.

## Navigating to the Dashboard

### What Shows by Default

The dashboard is the first screen after login. It shows a personalised greeting, quick stats, attention items, portfolio health, and workspace launchers.

### Personalised Greeting and Quick Stats

The top section shows your name, role, and key metrics: number of active services, check-ins due this week, and overdue items.

## Attention Required

### Overdue Items — What Needs Immediate Action

Overdue items include past-due check-ins, unresolved SLA breaches, and engagements with declining health scores. Each item links directly to the relevant engagement or action.

### Upcoming Items — What's Coming Soon

Upcoming items show check-ins due this week, approaching contract renewals, and scheduled milestones. This helps you plan your workload.

---

## Portfolio Health

### Overall Score (0-100)

The portfolio health card shows an aggregated health score across all your services and engagements. The score combines finance, performance, and capacity health.

### Domain Sub-Scores

Below the overall score, see the breakdown by domain: Finance health, Performance health, Capacity health. Identify which domain is dragging the score down.

### Number of Services Reporting

See how many of your services have recent data. Services without recent check-ins may need attention — their health scores may be stale.

## AI Insights

### AI-Generated Recommendations

The dashboard may show AI-generated insights highlighting trends, anomalies, or recommended actions across your portfolio.

### Acting on Insights

Each insight links to the relevant engagement or capability. Click through to take action — run a check-in, create a scenario, or generate a summary.
