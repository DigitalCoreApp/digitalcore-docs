# Configuring Rate Cards and Contract Pricing

Rate cards define how DigitalCore calculates labour costs and how contract-specific pricing overrides organisation defaults.

---

## Set Up Organisation Rate Cards

### Creating Roles in the Capacity Catalog

Go to **Configuration → Library / Catalogs → Roles & Rates**. Add your organisation's standard roles: Senior Consultant, Project Manager, Service Desk Analyst, Developer, etc.

### Adding Default Rates per Role

For each role, set the default hourly rate. This rate is used for automatic labour cost calculations when no contract-specific override exists.

---

## Configure Contract-Specific Rates

### Overriding Rates for Specific Contracts

Open a contract's detail page and go to the **Rates** tab. Add rate overrides for specific roles. For example, if the standard rate for Senior Consultant is €150/hour but this contract specifies €135/hour, add the override here.

### Engagement-Specific Rate Variants

For maximum granularity, rates can be set with engagement-level specificity within a contract. This handles multi-engagement contracts where different engagements may have different pricing.

## Configure SLA Terms

### Adding Performance Terms to a Contract

In the contract detail, go to the **SLA Terms** tab. Add terms for each KPI that carries financial consequences:

1. **Select the KPI** — from the performance catalog
2. **Set the threshold** — the value that triggers a breach
3. **Choose the operator** — greater than or less than
4. **Define the penalty** — fixed amount, percentage, or tiered

### Setting Thresholds and Penalty Types

For tiered penalties, define multiple levels. Example for Availability:

| Threshold | Penalty |
|-----------|---------|
| Below 99.5% | €1,000 |
| Below 99.0% | €5,000 |
| Below 98.0% | €15,000 |

## Verify Your Setup

### Testing: How DigitalCore Selects the Right Rate

Enter test capacity hours and verify that the automatic labour cost uses the expected rate. Check the finance grid to see which rate was applied.

### Common Issues and Troubleshooting

- **Wrong rate applied?** Check whether the contract rate is linked to the correct engagement. Contract-level rates override organisation defaults.
- **No cost generated?** Verify that the capacity role has a linked finance catalog item (typically "Labour Cost — COGS").
