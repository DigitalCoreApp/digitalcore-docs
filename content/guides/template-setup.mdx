# Setting Up Templates for a New Engagement

Templates define what you track on each engagement. This guide walks you through creating finance, performance, and capacity templates and assigning them to engagements.

---

## Before You Start

### Ensure Catalog Items Exist

Before creating templates, verify that the catalog items you need are already in the system:

- **Finance Catalog** — P&L line items (revenue types, cost categories)
- **Performance Catalog** — KPI definitions (metrics, measurement direction, default targets)
- **Capacity Catalog** — Roles (job titles with default hourly rates)

If you need new catalog items, add them first in **Configuration → Library / Catalogs**.

### Understand How Templates Flow to Engagements

Templates are reusable configurations that define what to track. When you assign a template to an engagement, engagement-level copies are created that inherit the template defaults but can be customised per engagement.

---

## Create a Finance Template

### Adding P&L Line Items from the Finance Catalog

Go to **Configuration → Templates → Finance**. Create a new template and give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Managed Services — Standard P&L"). Add items from the finance catalog: select revenue lines, COGS items, and operating expense items.

### Configuring Default Values per Item

For each item, you can optionally set default values — default planned amounts that pre-populate when the template is assigned. Leave defaults blank if targets vary per engagement.

---

## Create a Performance Template

### Adding KPIs from the Performance Catalog

Go to **Configuration → Templates → Performance**. Create a new template and add KPIs from the performance catalog. Each KPI inherits its measurement direction and default target from the catalog.

### Setting Targets

Override the default targets if needed for this template. For example, a premium service template might set Availability to 99.9% while a standard template uses 99.5%.

---

## Create a Capacity Template

### Adding Roles from the Capacity Catalog

Go to **Configuration → Templates → Capacity**. Create a new template and add roles from the capacity catalog. Each role inherits its default hourly rate.

### Setting Planned Hours and FTE Targets

For each role, set the baseline planned hours per month. DigitalCore automatically calculates the FTE equivalent.

---

## Assign Templates to an Engagement

### What Gets Created Automatically

When you assign a template to an engagement, DigitalCore creates engagement-level configurations for each template item. These are individual copies that can be customised without affecting the original template.

### Verifying the Assignment

After assignment, open the engagement's check-in tab. You should see the finance grid populated with the template's line items, the performance grid with KPIs, and the capacity grid with roles. All ready for targets and actuals.

## Advanced: Project Templates

### Pre-Configured Workstreams, Milestones, and Deliverables

Project templates are separate from the three data-domain templates. They define the timeline structure for project-based engagements: workstreams (phases), milestones (gates), and deliverables.

### Reusing Project Structures Across Engagements

Assign a project template to an engagement to create a pre-populated timeline. Adjust dates and details per engagement while maintaining a consistent project structure.
