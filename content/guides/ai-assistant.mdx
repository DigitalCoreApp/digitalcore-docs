# Using the AI Assistant

The AI assistant is your natural-language interface to DigitalCore. Ask questions, record data, generate reports, and explore scenarios through conversation.

## What Can the AI Do?

### Seven Capabilities Following the Management Workflow

The AI assistant is organised around the service management workflow: Monitor, Record, Diagnose, Plan, Decide, Learn, Communicate. Each capability is accessed through natural language conversation.

### Natural Language Interface

Interact with the AI using plain language — no special commands or syntax needed. The AI understands context from your conversation and can work with your live data.

---

## Example Conversations

### Health Monitoring

**Ask:** *"How is the Acme Cloud Hosting engagement doing?"*

The AI returns the current health score, domain breakdowns, top concerns, and trend direction.

---

### Recording Data

**Ask:** *"Record 160 hours for Senior Developer on the Acme engagement for January"*

The AI validates the role, engagement, and period, then records the hours. Automated labour cost calculations trigger normally.

**Ask:** *"Record €50,000 revenue for the Acme engagement in January"*

The AI identifies the correct revenue line item and records the actual value.

---

### Generating Reports

**Ask:** *"Summarise the Acme engagement for Q4, written for the customer"*

The AI generates a structured narrative summary with audience-appropriate language, covering financial performance, KPI status, and recommendations.

---

### Scenario Modelling

**Ask:** *"What if we reduce costs by 10% on the Acme engagement?"*

The AI creates a scenario with a 10% cost reduction driver and shows the projected financial impact.

---

### Learning

**Ask:** *"What does gross margin mean?"*

The AI explains the metric, provides the formula, includes industry benchmarks, and offers tips for improvement.

**Ask:** *"Show me the playbook for margin erosion"*

The AI retrieves the relevant playbook with context on when to use it and what data to examine.
