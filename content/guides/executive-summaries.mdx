## What is an Executive Summary?

### Multi-Section Report with AI-Generated Narratives

An executive summary is a structured report covering one or more engagements over a defined period. It includes sections for financial performance, KPI status, team utilisation, and more — each with AI-generated narrative text tailored to your chosen audience.

### When to Create One

- **Monthly** — Summarise the past month for internal stakeholders
- **Quarterly** — Provide a comprehensive review for management or customers
- **Client-Facing** — Create a report tailored for external audiences

---

## Create a New Summary

### Step 1: Select Engagement

Navigate to **Intelligence → Summaries** and click **Create New**. Select the engagement (or engagements) to include.

### Step 2: Select Timelines to Include

Choose which timelines (engagements, workstreams) should contribute data to the report.

### Step 3: Choose Report Template

Select a report template that defines the structure: **Weekly Update**, **Monthly Review**, or **Client Report**. Each template includes different section types.

### Step 4: Set Period

Define the period the summary covers — a single month, a quarter, or a custom date range.

## Using the Summary Editor

### Available Section Types

The editor presents a list of sections, each covering a different aspect:

- **Financial Snapshot** — Revenue, costs, margins, variance
- **KPI Overview** — Performance metrics with RAG status
- **Team Utilisation** — Capacity hours and FTE allocation
- **Highlights** — Notable achievements or milestones
- **Risks & Issues** — Items needing attention
- **Recommendations** — Suggested actions

### Toggling Section Visibility

Show or hide sections depending on your audience. A customer-facing report might hide internal utilisation data, while an internal review shows everything.

### Health Banner

The summary header shows a health banner — **Healthy**, **At Risk**, or **Critical** — based on the engagement's current health score.

## AI Narratives

### Generating AI Text for Individual Sections

Click the AI generation button on any section to produce narrative prose. The AI analyses the data for that section and writes a clear summary: "Revenue was 8% above plan in Q4, driven primarily by project work on the cloud migration initiative…"

### Regenerating All Sections

Click **Regenerate All** to produce fresh AI text for every section at once.

### Audience Targeting

Select the target audience before generating:

| Audience | Style |
|----------|-------|
| **Internal** | Candid, includes internal metrics, references team names |
| **Customer** | Professional, focuses on service delivery and SLA compliance |
| **Executive** | High-level, emphasises strategic implications and decisions needed |
| **Board** | Condensed, focuses on financials and risk |
