# Frequently Asked Questions

Product-specific questions about using DigitalCore. For general questions about pricing, security, and the company, see links at the bottom of this page.

---

## Getting Started

### How do I create an account?

Visit [digitalcore.app](https://digitalcore.app) and click **Get Started**. Enter your email, create a password, and follow the setup wizard to name your organisation. No credit card required for the free tier. Full walkthrough: [Create Your Organisation](/docs/getting-started/organisation).

### How do I invite my team?

Go to **Organisation → Users → Invite User**. Enter their email and assign a role (Admin, Manager, Operator, or Viewer). They'll receive an email invitation with a link to set up their account. Full details: [Create Your Organisation](/docs/getting-started/organisation).

### How long does setup take?

A basic setup (one service, one engagement, one template) takes about 30 minutes. You can start entering data immediately after. For organisations with large portfolios, use [bulk import](/docs/guides/data-import) to accelerate onboarding.

### Can I import data from spreadsheets?

Yes. DigitalCore supports Excel (.xlsx, .xls) and CSV imports for services, engagements, contracts, partners, stakeholders, and financial data. Download a template, fill it in, upload, and validate. Full guide: [Importing Data from Excel/CSV](/docs/guides/data-import).

## Core Features

### What is a check-in?

A check-in is the monthly process of entering actual data — revenue received, costs incurred, KPI results, and hours worked — against your planned targets. It takes 20-30 minutes per engagement. Full guide: [Running a Monthly Check-in](/docs/guides/monthly-checkin).

### How does DigitalCore track what I plan vs. what actually happens?

Every data item follows the **Plan → Actual** pattern. You set planned values (targets) and later enter actual values (results). DigitalCore calculates the variance and updates health scores automatically. Full explanation: [Planning and Actuals](/docs/concepts/planning-and-actuals).

### How do automated cost calculations work?

When you enter capacity hours for a role, DigitalCore multiplies the hours by the applicable hourly rate and creates a cost entry in the finance domain automatically. Rates follow a priority hierarchy: engagement-specific > contract-level > organisation default. Full explanation: [Automated Cost and Penalty Calculations](/docs/concepts/automation).

### How does scenario modelling work?

Create a scenario, add drivers (percentage changes, absolute adjustments, or fixed values), and see the projected financial impact. Compare multiple scenarios side by side, then commit the chosen one to your live plan. Full guide: [Creating and Evaluating Scenarios](/docs/guides/scenarios).

### What is an executive summary?

A multi-section report covering financial performance, KPI status, team utilisation, and recommendations for a specific period and engagement. AI generates the narrative text, and you can target the audience (internal, customer, executive, board). Full guide: [Building an Executive Summary](/docs/guides/executive-summaries).

### What are templates and catalogs?

**Catalogs** define the master list of things you can track (P&L line items, KPIs, roles). **Templates** are reusable configurations that select items from catalogs and set defaults. Assign templates to engagements to set up what you'll track. Full explanation: [Catalogs & Libraries](/docs/concepts/catalogs).

### How does delivery attribution work?

Each planned and actual value can be tagged with a delivery party — the customer or deliverer responsible. This enables cost allocation, showback reporting, and multi-vendor tracking. Full explanation: [Delivery Attribution](/docs/concepts/delivery-attribution).

## AI & MCP

### What MCP tools can I connect?

DigitalCore offers two MCP servers: a **free server** with 6 knowledge tools (no account needed) and a **paid server** with 13+ operational tools (requires API key). Both work with Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, ChatGPT, and Windsurf. Full details: [MCP & Integrations Overview](/docs/mcp-and-integrations/).

### How do I get an API key for paid MCP?

Go to **Settings → API Keys** in the DigitalCore app, click **Generate New Key**, set permissions and expiration, and copy the key into your MCP client configuration. Full guide: [API Keys](/docs/mcp-and-integrations/api-keys).
