# API Keys

## What Are API Keys?

### Authentication for Paid MCP Access

API keys authenticate your identity when using DigitalCore's paid MCP tools or programmatic API access. Each key is tied to your user account and inherits your organisation's data access permissions.

## Generating a Key

### Settings → API Keys Tab

Navigate to **Settings → API Keys** in the DigitalCore app. Click **Generate New Key**. Give the key a descriptive name (e.g., "Claude Desktop — Work Laptop").

### Key Permissions

Select the permission scope for the key:

- **Read** — Monitor, diagnose, and query data only
- **Read-Write** — All read permissions plus recording data and managing scenarios
- **Admin** — Full access including configuration changes

Use the minimum permission level needed for each use case.

### Expiration Settings

Set an expiration date for the key. Options include 30 days, 90 days, 180 days, 1 year, or a custom date. 90 days is recommended as a balance between security and convenience.

## Managing Keys

### Viewing Active Keys

The API Keys tab shows all your active keys with their names, permission level, creation date, expiration date, and last used date.

### Revoking a Key

Click **Revoke** to immediately disable a key. The key stops working instantly and cannot be re-enabled. Revocation is logged for audit purposes.

### Key Rotation Best Practice

Rotate keys before they expire. Generate a new key, update your MCP client configuration, verify connectivity, then revoke the old key. This avoids any downtime.

## Security Best Practices

### Never Share Keys in Code Repositories

API keys should never be committed to version control. Store them in your MCP client's local configuration file or in environment variables.

### Use Scoped Permissions

Create separate keys for different tools or workstations, each with the minimum required permissions. If one key is compromised, revoke it without affecting other integrations.

### Rotate Keys Periodically

Even if keys haven't expired, rotate them on a regular schedule (quarterly recommended). This limits the window of exposure if a key is silently compromised.
