# Paid MCP Tools Reference

## Setup Requirements

### API Key Required

Paid MCP tools require an API key from your DigitalCore account. Generate a key at **Settings → API Keys** and add it to your MCP client configuration. See [API Keys](/mcp-and-integrations/api-keys) for detailed instructions.

### Configuration with API Key

Add the paid server to your MCP client with your API key:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "digitalcore": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@anthropic-ai/mcp-remote", "https://mcp.digitalcore.app/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "DIGITALCORE_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Monitor Tools

### Check Portfolio Health — Aggregate Health Across Your Portfolio

Returns a health snapshot of your portfolio: overall score, domain breakdowns, list of services with their health scores, and attention items needing action.

### Check Engagement Health — Detailed Status of a Single Engagement

Returns the health score, domain sub-scores (finance, performance, capacity), top concerns, trend direction (improving/declining/stable), and any anomalies for a specific engagement.

---

## Record Tools

### Record Hours — Log Hours by Role

Record capacity hours for a specific role on an engagement for a given month. Automatically triggers labour cost calculation (hours × rate → finance entry).

### Record Finance Actual — Enter P&L Actuals

Record a financial actual value (revenue or cost) for a specific line item, engagement, and month.

### Record Performance — Enter KPI Values

Record a KPI actual value. Automatically triggers SLA breach detection — if the value breaches the contract threshold, a penalty event and (optionally) a finance entry are created.

---

## Diagnose Tools

### Generate Showback Report — IT Cost Allocation by Department

Generates a showback report showing how IT costs are allocated across business units/customers based on delivery attribution data. Useful for chargeback and transparency.

---

## Plan Tools

### Generate Scenario Options — AI Creates Multiple What-If Variants

Describe a situation or goal, and the AI generates 2-4 distinct scenario variants with different approaches (conservative, balanced, aggressive) and projected impacts.

### Create Scenario — Build a Blank Scenario Manually

Creates a new empty scenario for a specified engagement, ready for drivers to be added.

### Add Driver — Apply an Economic Driver to a Scenario

Adds a driver to an existing scenario: type (percentage, absolute, fixed), target domain, target items, and the value of the change.

---

## Decide Tools

### Refine Scenario — Adjust and Recalculate

Modify an existing scenario's drivers and recalculate the projected impact.

### Compare and Commit — Side-by-Side Comparison and Adoption

Compare two or more scenarios side by side and commit the chosen one, writing its projections into your live plan.

### Undo Commit — Reverse a Previous Commitment

Revert a committed scenario, restoring the previous plan values.

### Check Accuracy — How Good Was the Prediction?

After actuals are recorded, compare a scenario's projections against what actually happened to measure prediction accuracy.

---

## Communicate Tools

### Summarise Period — Narrative Summary with Audience Targeting

Generates a narrative summary of an engagement's performance for a specified period, tailored to the target audience (Internal, Customer, Executive, Board).

### Generate Executive Summary — Multi-Section Report Draft

Creates a full multi-section executive summary report with AI-generated narratives for each section.
