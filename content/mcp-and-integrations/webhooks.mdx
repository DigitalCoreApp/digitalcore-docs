# Webhooks & API (Future)

## Planned Capabilities

### Event Types Coming Soon

DigitalCore is developing a webhook system that will notify external systems when key events occur:

- **Engagement health change** — When a health score crosses a RAG threshold
- **SLA breach detected** — When a performance actual triggers a breach
- **Check-in completed** — When a monthly check-in is finished
- **Decision recorded** — When a governance case is decided
- **Scenario committed** — When a scenario is adopted as the new plan

### Target Use Cases

Webhooks will enable integrations with notification services (Slack, Teams), workflow automation tools (Zapier, Make), and custom internal systems.
