# MCP & Integrations

## What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

### MCP in 30 Seconds

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that lets AI assistants connect to external tools and data sources. Instead of copy-pasting information into a chat window, MCP lets your AI assistant query DigitalCore directly — checking engagement health, recording data, running scenarios, and generating reports through natural language.

### Why MCP Matters for Service Management

Service managers work across multiple tools and data sources. MCP eliminates the context switching: ask your AI assistant about margin trends, record this month's hours, or generate a client-facing summary — all without leaving your AI tool of choice.
