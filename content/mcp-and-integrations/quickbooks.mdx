# QuickBooks Integration

## Overview

### What Data Syncs Between QuickBooks and DigitalCore

The QuickBooks integration syncs financial data between the two systems: invoices, expenses, and payments from QuickBooks can be mapped to DigitalCore's finance line items. This enables you to use QuickBooks as your system of record for accounting while using DigitalCore for service-level financial analysis.

## Setup

### Connecting Your QuickBooks Account

Navigate to **Configuration → Integrations** and click **Connect QuickBooks**. You'll be redirected to QuickBooks for OAuth authorisation. Grant access to the relevant QuickBooks company.

### Mapping QuickBooks Items to Your Catalogs

After connecting, map QuickBooks accounts and items to your DigitalCore finance catalog entries. For example, map your QuickBooks "Professional Services Revenue" account to DigitalCore's "Consulting Revenue" catalog item.

## Sync Behaviour

### What Syncs Automatically

Once configured, new invoices and expenses in QuickBooks are automatically picked up during the sync cycle and matched to the corresponding DigitalCore engagement and finance line item.

### Manual Sync Triggers

Trigger a manual sync at any time from the Integrations page. Use this when you need fresh data immediately rather than waiting for the next automatic sync.

### Conflict Resolution

If data exists in both systems for the same period and item, the sync highlights the conflict and lets you choose which value to keep.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Connection Issues

- **"Connection expired"** — QuickBooks OAuth tokens expire periodically. Re-authenticate from the Integrations page.
- **"Company mismatch"** — Ensure you're connected to the correct QuickBooks company.

### Re-authenticating

If the connection drops, go to **Configuration → Integrations**, disconnect the existing QuickBooks link, and reconnect. Your mappings are preserved.
