# Excel / CSV Import

## Supported Import Types

### Entity Import: Services, Engagements, Contracts, Partners

Import core entities in bulk when onboarding an existing portfolio. Each entity type has a dedicated import template with the required and optional fields.

### Financial Data Bulk Import

Import historical financial data (planned and actual values) for existing engagements. Useful for migrating from spreadsheets or other tracking systems.

## Preparing Your File

### Download a Template

Download the pre-formatted Excel template for your import type from the Bulk Upload page. Templates include column headers, data types, example rows, and validation notes.

### Required and Optional Columns

Each template clearly marks which columns are required (e.g., entity name, reference ID) and which are optional (e.g., description, category). Required fields that are empty will generate validation errors.

### Format Requirements

- **File formats**: `.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.csv`
- **Date format**: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- **Currency**: Numeric values without currency symbols
- **Text encoding**: UTF-8 (for CSV files)

## Upload Workflow

### Configuration → Bulk Upload

Navigate to **Configuration → Bulk Upload** and select the entity type to import.

### Staging, Validation, and Confirmation Steps

Upload your file to enter the staging view. Each row is validated against the schema — valid rows are green, errors are highlighted in red with messages. Fix errors in the staging table or re-upload. Click **Confirm** when all rows validate.

## Troubleshooting Imports

### Common Errors and How to Fix Them

- **"Required field missing"** — Check the template for required columns and fill them in
- **"Invalid date format"** — Use YYYY-MM-DD format
- **"Reference not found"** — The entity you reference (e.g., a service name) doesn't exist yet — create it first or fix the spelling
- **"Duplicate detected"** — An entity with the same key fields already exists — choose to skip or update
