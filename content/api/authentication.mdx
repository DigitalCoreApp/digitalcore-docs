# API Authentication

The DigitalCore API uses API keys for authentication.

## API keys

API keys are long-lived tokens for server-to-server integrations.

### Getting a key

1. Go to **Settings → API**
2. Click **Generate API Key**
3. Give it a descriptive name
4. Copy the key immediately

### Using the key

Include the API key in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer dc_live_abc123...
```

### Key types

| Type | Prefix | Use |
|------|--------|-----|
| **Live** | `dc_live_` | Production data |
| **Test** | `dc_test_` | Sandbox environment |

## Security best practices

**Do**:
- ✅ Store keys in environment variables
- ✅ Use different keys for different environments
- ✅ Rotate keys periodically
- ✅ Use minimum required permissions

**Don't**:
- ❌ Commit keys to source control
- ❌ Share keys via chat/email
- ❌ Use keys in client-side code
- ❌ Reuse keys across applications

## Revoking keys

If a key is compromised:

1. Go to **Settings → API**
2. Find the key
3. Click **Revoke**
4. Generate a new key
5. Update your integrations

## Permissions

API keys inherit the permissions of the user who created them.

For restricted access, create a dedicated service account with limited permissions.
