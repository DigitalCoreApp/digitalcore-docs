# What is DigitalCore?

DigitalCore is a Service Economics Intelligence platform for professional
services firms. It analyzes service delivery costs, margins, and performance
to show which services and clients are profitable — and recommends what to
do about it.

## Who is DigitalCore for?

DigitalCore serves mid-market professional services organizations with
50–250 FTE: consultancies, MSPs, MSSPs, IT service providers, and internal
shared services teams.

## What problems does it solve?

Most service organizations cannot answer: "What does it cost to deliver
this service to this client?" They have time tracking in one system,
costs in another, finance in spreadsheets, and no unified view.

DigitalCore replaces this with:

- **Automatic P&L calculation** — hours × rates = margin, updated continuously
- **Cross-domain scenario modeling** — change price, staffing, or AI adoption
  and see impact on margin, capacity, and SLA simultaneously
- **29 service management playbooks** with KPIs and recommended actions
- **AI-native architecture** — built for AI agents from day one
