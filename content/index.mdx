# What is DigitalCore?

## The Problem: Invisible Service Economics

Most service businesses don't know which engagements make money and which ones quietly drain it. Margins erode through scope creep, untracked hours, missed SLA penalties, and cost overruns — but the spreadsheet only tells you after it's too late. Finance sees the P&L at month-end. Delivery sees utilisation numbers. Nobody sees the full picture per engagement, in real time.

## What DigitalCore Does

DigitalCore is a service economics platform that gives you real-time visibility into the financial health of every service engagement. It connects three data domains — Finance, Performance, and Capacity — into a single workspace where planned values meet actual results, automated calculations replace manual formulas, and AI-powered analysis surfaces what needs attention.

You track what you planned. You record what actually happened. DigitalCore shows you the gap — and helps you decide what to do about it.

## Who It's For

DigitalCore is built for organisations that deliver services and need to understand the economics behind them:

- **Managed Service Providers (MSPs)** managing device-based or per-user contracts
- **Professional services and consulting firms** tracking project margins and utilisation
- **IT service desks** measuring SLA compliance and cost-per-ticket
- **Creative and marketing agencies** managing fixed-fee engagements against actual effort
- **NGOs and grant-funded organisations** tracking program costs against budgets

It's used by operations leaders, finance managers, delivery managers, and service desk leads — anyone who needs to answer "are we making money on this engagement?"

# How It Works

## The Engagement-Centric Model (30-second version)

Everything in DigitalCore centres around **engagements** — a specific service delivered to a specific customer over a defined period. Each engagement tracks its own financials, performance metrics, and capacity allocation. Engagements are grouped under services, linked to contracts, and organised into portfolios for a top-down strategic view.

## Three Data Domains: Finance, Performance, Capacity

Each engagement tracks three types of data:

- **Finance** — Revenue, costs, and margins. P&L line items with planned and actual values per month. Categories include revenue, cost of goods sold (COGS), and operating expenses.
- **Performance** — KPIs and SLAs. Metrics like response time, resolution rate, or customer satisfaction, each with targets and thresholds. When actuals breach SLA thresholds, penalties are calculated automatically.
- **Capacity** — Hours by role. Planned and actual hours for each role assigned to the engagement. FTE equivalents are derived automatically from logged hours.

## Automated Cost and Penalty Calculations

DigitalCore automates the calculations that typically require manual spreadsheet work:

- **Capacity → Finance:** When you log hours for a role, DigitalCore multiplies hours by the applicable rate (from rate cards or contract overrides) and creates the corresponding labour cost entry in Finance automatically.
- **Performance → Finance:** When a KPI actual breaches an SLA threshold defined in the contract, DigitalCore calculates the penalty amount (fixed, percentage, or tiered) and creates a penalty cost entry in Finance automatically.

No manual formulas. No copy-paste between sheets. Cross-domain triggers keep everything in sync.

# Key Capabilities

## Monthly Check-ins — Record and track service economics

Check-ins are the core operational rhythm. Each month, you enter actuals for finance, performance, and capacity. DigitalCore compares them against your plans, calculates variances, assigns RAG status (Red / Amber / Green), and updates health scores — all in real time as you enter data.

## Scenario Intelligence — What-if modelling for service decisions

Before committing to a pricing change, staffing adjustment, or contract renegotiation, use scenarios to model the impact. DigitalCore's AI can generate multiple scenario variants with different economic drivers, project the financial effects, and let you compare options side by side. When you're ready, commit a scenario and its values become your new plan.

## Executive Summaries — AI-generated stakeholder reports

Generate narrative reports for any engagement or set of engagements. Choose your audience (executive, operational, financial), select the period, and DigitalCore drafts a structured summary with health indicators, key findings, and recommended actions. Edit, finalize, and export as PDF.

## 29 Playbooks — Operational response guides

Playbooks are structured guides for common service management challenges: margin erosion, capacity shortfalls, SLA breaches, renewal risk, and more. Each playbook includes warning signs, diagnostics, a phased action plan, and the metrics to track. Browse all playbooks at [digitalcore.app/learn/playbooks](https://digitalcore.app/learn/playbooks).

## MCP Integration — Connect your AI tools directly

DigitalCore supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing you to query your service data, record actuals, generate reports, and run scenarios directly from AI tools like Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, ChatGPT, and Windsurf. A free MCP server with 6 tools is available without an account. Paid MCP access connects to your live data.

- [vs. Spreadsheets](https://digitalcore.app/compare/excel) — Why spreadsheet-based service tracking breaks down at scale
- [vs. ServiceNow](https://digitalcore.app/compare/servicenow) — ITSM tools track tickets, not economics
- [vs. Monday.com](https://digitalcore.app/compare/monday) — Project management tools miss the financial layer
- [vs. Jira](https://digitalcore.app/compare/jira) — Issue tracking without service economics context
