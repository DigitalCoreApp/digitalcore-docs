# What is service economics?

Service economics is the practice of measuring, analyzing, and optimizing the financial performance of service delivery.

## The challenge

Unlike product businesses, services are:
- **Intangible** — hard to standardize
- **People-intensive** — costs vary by who delivers
- **Time-based** — revenue tied to hours
- **Variable** — each engagement is different

This makes profitability hard to measure and predict.

## Key questions service economics answers

1. **Which engagements make money?** — and which lose money
2. **What does it really cost to deliver?** — including overhead
3. **How should we price?** — based on true costs
4. **Where are the risks?** — before they become problems

## The DigitalCore approach

We believe service economics should be:

- **Real-time** — not quarterly reports
- **Complete** — full cost picture, not just direct costs
- **Actionable** — insights that drive decisions
- **Accessible** — for everyone, not just finance

## Getting started

Start with these fundamentals:

1. [Margin calculation](/docs/service-economics/margin-calculation) — understand profitability
2. [Cost attribution](/docs/service-economics/cost-attribution) — track all costs
3. [Whale curve](/docs/service-economics/whale-curve) — see profit distribution
