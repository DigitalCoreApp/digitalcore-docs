# What is the whale curve?

The whale curve is a visual representation of how profit is distributed across engagements — and it often reveals surprising truths.

## How to read the whale curve

The whale curve plots:
- **X-axis**: Engagements ranked by profitability
- **Y-axis**: Cumulative profit

A typical whale curve shows:
1. Top engagements generate more than 100% of total profit
2. Middle engagements contribute little
3. Bottom engagements destroy profit

## What it reveals

Most organizations find that:
- **Top 20%** of engagements generate 150-200% of profit
- **Bottom 20%** of engagements lose 50-100% of that profit
- Net profit is the difference

This hidden unprofitability is invisible without full costing.

## How to use the whale curve

**For unprofitable engagements**:
- Identify root causes (scope creep, underpricing, inefficiency)
- Renegotiate or exit
- Improve delivery processes

**For profitable engagements**:
- Understand what makes them work
- Replicate the approach
- Prioritize similar opportunities

## Accessing the whale curve
