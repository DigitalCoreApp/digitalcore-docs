# How is margin calculated?

DigitalCore calculates margins at multiple levels to give complete visibility into profitability.

## Margin formula

```
Margin = Revenue - Total Costs
Margin % = (Revenue - Total Costs) / Revenue × 100
```

## Cost components

Total costs include:

| Cost Type | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Direct Labor** | Time × internal cost rate | $50/hr × 100 hrs = $5,000 |
| **Direct Expenses** | Engagement-specific costs | Software licenses, travel |
| **Allocated Overhead** | Shared costs distributed | Office, admin, tools |

## Example calculation

**Revenue**: $50,000

**Costs**:
- Direct labor: $25,000
- Direct expenses: $3,000
- Allocated overhead: $7,000
- **Total**: $35,000

**Margin**: $50,000 - $35,000 = **$15,000**
**Margin %**: $15,000 / $50,000 = **30%**

## Margin levels

DigitalCore shows margins at:
- **Engagement** — individual project
- **Client** — all work for a client
- **Service** — service line performance
- **Portfolio** — company-wide

## Real-time vs. final

- **Current margin**: Based on work to date
- **Projected margin**: Forecast at completion
- **Final margin**: After engagement closes
