# How do I model scenarios?

Scenario modeling lets you simulate changes and see their impact on margins before committing.

## What can I model?

**Staffing changes**
- Add/remove team members
- Change role assignments
- Adjust hours allocation

**Pricing changes**
- Change bill rates
- Apply discounts
- Modify contract value

**Cost changes**
- Add expenses
- Adjust cost rates
- Change overhead allocation

## How do I create a scenario?

1. Open an engagement
2. Click **Scenarios** tab
3. Click **+ New Scenario**
4. Make changes to the modeled values
5. Click **Calculate** to see impact

## Comparing scenarios

View side-by-side:
- Current actuals
- Baseline projection
- Your scenario(s)

The comparison shows:
- Revenue impact
- Cost impact
- Margin change

## Committing a scenario

If you want to apply the scenario:

1. Review changes
2. Click **Commit Scenario**
3. Confirm

This doesn't change actuals — it updates projections and planning.

## Using AI assistance

Ask the AI assistant:
> "What happens to margin if I add a senior developer?"

It will create and analyze the scenario for you.
