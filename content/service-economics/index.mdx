# Service Economics

Service economics is the discipline of understanding, measuring, and optimizing the profitability of services delivered to clients.

## Why service economics matters

Professional services firms often struggle with:
- **Hidden unprofitability** — engagements that lose money
- **Cost invisibility** — unclear where costs actually go
- **Margin erosion** — scope creep eating profits
- **Pricing challenges** — not knowing true costs

DigitalCore brings financial clarity to every engagement.

## Core concepts

| Concept | What It Measures |
|---------|------------------|

| [Scenario Modeling](/docs/service-economics/scenario-modeling) | What-if analysis |
| [Whale Curve](/docs/service-economics/whale-curve) | Profit distribution |

## How DigitalCore helps

1. **Real-time margins** — know profitability as work happens
2. **Full cost visibility** — direct and allocated costs
3. **Actionable insights** — AI-powered recommendations
4. **Scenario modeling** — test decisions before making them
