# How does cost attribution work?

Cost attribution assigns all costs — direct and indirect — to the engagements that drive them.

## Why full cost attribution?

Without full costing, you only see direct costs. This misses:
- Overhead (office, IT, admin)
- Management time
- Training and development
- Sales and marketing

An engagement may look profitable on direct costs but lose money when fully loaded.

## Direct costs

Costs directly tied to an engagement:

- **Labor**: Hours × individual cost rate
- **Expenses**: Travel, software, materials
- **Subcontractors**: Third-party costs

These are straightforward — they're logged directly.

## Indirect (allocated) costs

Shared costs distributed across engagements:

| Cost Pool | Allocation Method |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Facilities** | By headcount or labor hours |
| **IT/Tools** | By headcount |
| **Admin** | By revenue or hours |
| **Management** | By team size |

## How allocation works

1. Collect overhead into cost pools
2. Choose allocation drivers
3. Calculate allocation rate
4. Apply to engagements proportionally

**Example**: $100,000 facilities cost ÷ 10,000 total labor hours = $10/hour allocated.

## Configuration

Set up cost pools and allocation rules in **Settings → Finance → Cost Allocation**.
