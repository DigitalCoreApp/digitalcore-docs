# How do I import data?

DigitalCore supports importing data from spreadsheets and other systems to get you started quickly.

## What data can I import?

- **Engagements** — client, contract value, dates, team assignments
- **Time entries** — historical hours logged by team members
- **Financial data** — revenue, costs, actuals
- **Team members** — roles, rates, availability
- **Clients** — organization details

## How do I import from Excel/CSV?

1. Navigate to **Settings → Import**
2. Download the import template for your data type
3. Fill in your data following the template format
4. Upload the completed file
5. Review the preview and confirm

## What format should my data be in?

Use our templates to ensure correct formatting:

- Date format: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Currency: Numbers only, no symbols
- Required fields marked with asterisk (*)

## How do I handle import errors?

DigitalCore validates data before importing:

- **Duplicate detection** — warns if records already exist
- **Format validation** — highlights incorrectly formatted fields
- **Missing required fields** — lists what's missing

Fix errors in your file and re-upload, or skip problematic rows.
