# How do I set up my first engagement?

Create your first engagement in DigitalCore to start tracking service economics.

## What information do I need?

Before creating an engagement, gather:

- **Client name** — the organization you're delivering services to
- **Engagement name** — a descriptive title (e.g., "Cloud Migration Phase 1")
- **Contract value** — total contract amount
- **Billing model** — fixed-fee, time & materials, or hybrid
- **Start and end dates** — engagement timeline
- **Team members** — who will work on this engagement

## How do I create an engagement?

1. Navigate to **Engagements** in the sidebar
2. Click **+ New Engagement**
3. Fill in the engagement details
4. Assign team members and their roles
5. Set up the billing structure
6. Click **Create Engagement**

## How do I configure billing?

DigitalCore supports multiple billing models:

- **Fixed-fee**: Set total contract value, revenue recognizes based on % complete
- **Time & Materials**: Revenue = hours × bill rate
- **Hybrid**: Combination of fixed and variable components

## What happens next?

Once created, your engagement appears in the Portfolio Cockpit. Team members can log time, and DigitalCore automatically calculates margins.
