# Configure Your Templates

## What Are Templates?

### Templates Define What You Track per Engagement

A template is a reusable configuration that defines the specific items you want to track. Without a template, an engagement has no data to collect. Templates answer the question: "What exactly do we measure for this type of service?"

### Organisation-Level Reusability — Define Once, Apply Many

Templates are defined at the organisation level and can be assigned to multiple engagements. If all your managed services engagements track the same P&L structure, create one finance template and assign it to every managed services engagement.

## Set Up a Finance Template

### Adding P&L Line Items from the Catalog

Go to Configuration → Templates → Finance Templates. Create a new template and add line items from the finance catalog. The catalog contains standard P&L categories that your organisation has defined — or you can generate defaults to get started quickly.

### Revenue, Costs, and Other Categories

Finance template items are organized by P&L category:

- **Revenue** — Monthly recurring revenue, project fees, ad-hoc charges
- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** — Direct labour, subcontractor costs, materials
- **Operating Expenses** — Overhead, tooling, travel

Each item has planned and actual values per month. Some items (like labour costs) can be populated automatically from capacity data.

## Set Up a Performance Template

### Adding KPIs from the Catalog

Create a performance template and add KPIs from the performance catalog — metrics like First Call Resolution, Response Time, Customer Satisfaction, or Uptime. Each KPI comes from the catalog with a standard definition.

### Targets and Measurement Direction

For each KPI, configure:

- **Target value** — What "good" looks like
- **Amber threshold** — The warning zone
- **Red threshold** — The failure zone
- **Direction** — Higher-is-better (e.g., satisfaction score), Lower-is-better (e.g., response time), or Target-is-best (e.g., utilisation %)

## Set Up a Capacity Template

### Adding Roles from the Catalog

Create a capacity template and add roles from the roles & rates catalog — positions like "Senior Consultant," "Service Desk Analyst," or "Project Manager." Each role has an associated hourly rate used for automatic cost calculations.

### Planned Hours per Role

Set the planned hours per month for each role. This becomes your capacity baseline. When actuals are entered, DigitalCore calculates FTE equivalents and utilisation rates automatically.

## Assign Templates to Engagements

### How Template Assignment Works

Go to your engagement and assign the finance, performance, and capacity templates you've created. You can assign different templates to different engagements — a managed services engagement might use a different KPI set than a consulting engagement.

### What Happens When You Assign a Template

When you assign a template, DigitalCore creates engagement-level configuration for each item. You can then set monthly targets (plans), and the check-in grid becomes available for entering actual values. Default settings from the template are inherited but can be overridden per engagement.
