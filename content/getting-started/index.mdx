## What You'll Set Up

### The 30-Minute Path to First Value

This guide walks you through everything you need to go from a blank account to your first service economics check-in. By the end, you'll have:

- An organisation with at least one team member
- A service with an active engagement
- Templates configured to track finance, performance, and capacity
- Your first monthly check-in entered
- A dashboard showing the health of your engagement

### Prerequisites

All you need is an email address and a modern web browser. No installation, no downloads, no credit card required for the free tier.

## Step-by-Step Overview

### Step 1: Create Your Organisation

Sign up, confirm your email, and set up your organisation details. This takes about 2 minutes. See [Create Your Organisation](/getting-started/organisation).

### Step 2: Define a Service

Create your first service — the thing you deliver to customers. Give it a name, description, category, and owner. See [Services, Engagements & Contracts](/getting-started/core-entities).

### Step 3: Create an Engagement

An engagement is a specific instance of delivering that service to a specific customer. Create one, link it to your service, and assign delivery parties. See [Services, Engagements & Contracts](/getting-started/core-entities).

### Step 4: Configure Templates

Templates define what you track per engagement. Set up finance line items (revenue, costs), performance KPIs, and capacity roles from the catalog. Assign templates to your engagement. See [Configure Your Templates](/getting-started/templates).

### Step 5: Enter Your First Check-in

Go to Operations, open your engagement, and enter actual values for the current month. Watch automated calculations fire — labour costs from hours, SLA penalties from breaches. See [Your First Check-in](/getting-started/first-checkin).

### Step 6: Read Your Dashboard

Return to the dashboard to see health scores, variance indicators, and attention items. See [Reading Your Dashboard](/getting-started/dashboard).
