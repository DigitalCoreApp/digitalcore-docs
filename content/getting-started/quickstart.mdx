# How do I get started with DigitalCore?

Set up your first engagement and see service economics data in 15 minutes.

## What do I need before starting?

- A DigitalCore account ([sign up](https://app.digitalcore.app/signup))
- Basic information about one service engagement (client name, contract value, team members)

## How do I create my first engagement?

1. Log in to [app.digitalcore.app](https://app.digitalcore.app)
2. Click **+ New Engagement** in the sidebar
3. Enter the engagement name and client
4. Set the contract value and billing type (fixed-fee or T&M)
5. Add team members who will work on this engagement

## How do I see financial performance?

Once team members log hours, DigitalCore automatically calculates:

- **Revenue recognition** based on your billing model
- **Labor costs** from hours × internal rates
- **Gross margin** updated in real-time

Navigate to **Finance → Engagement P&L** to see the breakdown.
