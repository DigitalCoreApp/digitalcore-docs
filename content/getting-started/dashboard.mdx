# Reading Your Dashboard

## The Dashboard Overview

### What You See on First Login

The dashboard is your home screen. It provides a high-level view of everything that needs your attention across all your services and engagements.

### Quick Stats: Active Services, Due This Week, Overdue

At the top, quick stat cards show: how many services are active, how many check-ins are due this week, and how many are overdue. These numbers update as you and your team complete check-ins.

## Dashboard Sections

### Attention Required — Overdue and Upcoming Items

The Attention Required section lists engagements that need action: overdue check-ins, recently breached SLAs, or engagements with deteriorating health scores. Items are sorted by urgency.

### Portfolio Health — Overall Score and Domain Breakdowns

If you've organised services into portfolios, the portfolio health section shows aggregate health scores. Each portfolio displays its overall score (0-100) and breakdowns by finance, performance, and capacity domains.

### Workspace Launchers — Jump to Operations, Decisions, Strategy

Quick-access cards let you jump directly to the three core workspaces:

- **Operations** — Manage engagements and check-ins
- **Decisions** — View and manage governance cases with scenarios
- **Strategy** — OKRs, cockpit, and AI initiatives

### AI Insights — Recommendations Based on Your Data

The AI Insights section surfaces observations and recommendations generated from your data: margin trends, capacity warnings, anomaly detection, and suggested actions.

### Quick Actions — New Check-in, Log Decision, View Summaries

Shortcut buttons for the most common tasks: start a new check-in, create a governance decision, or view recent executive summaries.

## Understanding Health Scores

### What 0-100 Means

Health scores range from 0 (critical) to 100 (excellent). They aggregate multiple factors including plan-vs-actual variance, data freshness, trend direction, and coverage (how many items have data entered).

### Finance, Performance, Capacity Sub-Scores

The overall health score is composed of three sub-scores — one per data domain. Each sub-score weighs the variance and RAG status of items in that domain. You can drill into any sub-score to see which specific items are driving it up or down.

### Data Freshness and Service Coverage

Health scores also factor in recency: an engagement with stale data (no check-in for 2+ months) will see its score decay. Service coverage measures what percentage of your services have active engagements with current data.

## What to Do Next

### Recommended Workflows for Week 1

After your first check-in and dashboard review:

1. **Invite at least one team member** — Delegate check-in duties to operators
2. **Set up a second engagement** — Compare two engagements side by side
3. **Explore scenarios** — Model a pricing change or staffing adjustment (see [Scenario Intelligence guide](/guides/scenarios))
4. **Generate an executive summary** — Create a stakeholder-ready report from your data (see [Executive Summaries guide](/guides/executive-summaries))
5. **Connect an AI tool via MCP** — Query your data from Claude, Cursor, or VS Code (see [MCP & Integrations](/mcp-and-integrations/))
