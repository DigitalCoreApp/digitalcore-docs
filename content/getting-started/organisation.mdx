# Create Your Organisation

## Sign Up and First Login

### Creating Your Account

Go to [digitalcore.app](https://digitalcore.app) and click **Start Free**. Enter your email address and choose a password. You'll receive a confirmation email within a few minutes.

### Confirming Your Email

Click the confirmation link in the email. This verifies your identity and activates your account. If you don't receive the email, check your spam folder or request a new one from the login page.

### Choosing Your Plan

New accounts start on the free tier automatically. You can upgrade to a paid plan at any time from Settings → Subscription. See [Pricing & Plans](/account/pricing) or visit [digitalcore.app/pricing](https://digitalcore.app/pricing) for details.

## Set Up Your Organisation

### Organisation Name and Details

After your first login, you'll be prompted to name your organisation. This is the company or entity that owns the data. All services, engagements, and users belong to this organisation. Your data is fully isolated — other organisations cannot see it.

### Organisational Structure (Units / Departments)

Optionally, define your internal structure by adding organisational units or departments. These can be used later to group services, assign ownership, and filter dashboards.

### Adding External Partners

If you work with external delivery partners, contractors, or customer organisations, add them under Configuration → Partners. Partners can be assigned as delivery parties on engagements, enabling you to track which external organisation is responsible for specific costs or metrics.

## Invite Your Team

### User Roles: Admin, Manager, Operator, Viewer

DigitalCore uses four roles that control what each user can see and do:

| Role | What They Can Do |
|------|-----------------|
| **Admin** | Full access. Manage users, organisation settings, templates, catalogs, and all data. |
| **Manager** | View and edit engagements, run scenarios, generate summaries. Cannot manage organisation settings. |
| **Operator** | Enter check-in data, view dashboards and reports. Cannot create or modify templates. |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to dashboards, reports, and engagement data. |

### Sending Invitations

Go to Organisation → Users and click **Invite User**. Enter the person's email and select their role. They'll receive an email invitation with a link to set up their account.

### What Invited Users See

Invited users land on the same dashboard as everyone else, but their available actions depend on their role. An Operator sees the check-in grid but can't create new services. A Viewer can browse dashboards but can't edit data.

### Invitation Expiry and Resending

Invitations expire after a set period. If someone hasn't accepted, you can resend the invitation or cancel it from the Pending Invitations page.
