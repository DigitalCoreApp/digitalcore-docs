# Service Economics in DigitalCore

## What is Service Economics?

### Quick Definition

Service economics is the discipline of understanding how services make or lose money. It combines revenue tracking, cost attribution, performance measurement, and capacity management into a unified view of financial health — per engagement, per service, and across your portfolio.

This page focuses on how DigitalCore implements these concepts in practice.

## How DigitalCore Implements Service Economics

### Real-Time P&L per Engagement

Every engagement in DigitalCore has its own profit-and-loss statement. Revenue, costs, and margins are tracked monthly with planned (target) and actual values. Unlike spreadsheet-based reporting that lags by weeks or months, DigitalCore's P&L updates as soon as data is entered.

### Automated Cost Attribution — Hours × Rates = COGS, Automatically

When someone logs capacity hours for a role, DigitalCore multiplies those hours by the applicable hourly rate and creates the corresponding labour cost entry in the finance domain. No spreadsheet formulas. No manual copying between sheets. The cost appears instantly.

### SLA-Linked Financial Penalties — Breach Detection Triggers Cost Entries

When a KPI actual falls below (or exceeds) the threshold defined in the contract, DigitalCore detects the breach, calculates the penalty amount, and creates a penalty cost entry in finance. The penalty calculation supports fixed amounts, percentage of contract value, and tiered structures.

### Scenario-Based Decision Making — What-if Modelling Before You Commit

Before making a pricing change, staffing decision, or contract renegotiation, model the financial impact with scenarios. DigitalCore projects the effects across all three domains and lets you compare options side by side. Commit a scenario to adopt it as your plan.

## The Three Pillars in Practice

### Revenue Attribution — Track Who Pays for What, per Engagement

Each finance template item categorises revenue by type. Combined with delivery attribution, you can answer not just "how much revenue did this engagement generate?" but "which customer or business unit is responsible for that revenue?"

### Cost Visibility — Direct, Indirect, and Labour Costs with Delivery Party Tracking

Costs are categorised by P&L type (COGS, operating expenses) and can be attributed to specific delivery parties. Labour costs are auto-calculated from capacity hours. External costs are entered manually. Every cost is traceable to its source.

### Margin Analysis — Gross, Contribution, and Net Margins Updated Monthly

With revenue and costs tracked per engagement per month, margins are always current:

- **Gross margin** = Revenue minus direct costs (COGS)
- **Contribution margin** = Gross margin minus allocated operating expenses
- **Net margin** = The bottom line after all attributed costs

## What Makes This Different from a Spreadsheet

### Automated Calculations Replace Manual Formulas

In a spreadsheet, every formula is a point of failure. DigitalCore's automated triggers mean capacity hours always produce the correct cost entry, using the correct rate, in the correct finance line — without anyone writing or maintaining a formula.

### Cross-Domain Triggers Link Capacity, Performance, and Finance

Spreadsheets silo data by tab. DigitalCore connects the three domains: capacity drives finance costs, performance drives finance penalties. A change in one domain immediately reflects in the others.

### Real-Time Variance Tracking Instead of Month-End Surprises

Spreadsheet-based P&Ls are typically assembled at month-end, often with a 2-4 week lag. DigitalCore calculates variance as soon as actuals are entered, showing you the gap between plan and reality immediately.
