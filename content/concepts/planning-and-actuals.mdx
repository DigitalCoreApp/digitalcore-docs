# How DigitalCore Tracks What You Plan vs. What Actually Happens

## The Problem with Simple "Budget vs. Actual"

### Why One-Size-Fits-All Doesn't Work for Services

Traditional budgeting tools give you a single budget line and a single actual line. But service businesses need more nuance: each engagement has different line items, different KPIs, different roles. A consulting engagement tracks different P&L items than a managed services engagement.

### What Happens When Every Engagement Needs Different Config

Without per-engagement configuration, you end up with either: (a) a bloated universal template where most fields don't apply, or (b) dozens of custom spreadsheets, each with its own structure.

## How DigitalCore Solves This

### Organisation-Level Templates — Define What to Track Once

Templates define the structure: which line items, which KPIs, which roles. They're created once at the organisation level and reused across engagements of the same type.

### Engagement-Level Configuration — Override Where Needed

When a template is assigned to an engagement, DigitalCore creates engagement-level configurations that inherit the template defaults. You can override targets, thresholds, or delivery parties per engagement without changing the template.

### Monthly Targets — Set Goals per Period

For each active engagement, set monthly target values (plans) for finance items, KPI targets, and planned hours. These targets become the baseline for variance analysis.

### Monthly Actuals — Record What Really Happened

During monthly check-ins, enter what actually happened: real revenue, real costs, real KPI values, real hours. DigitalCore calculates the variance against plan automatically.

## How It Works in Practice

### Creating a Template with Standard Items from the Catalog

Go to Configuration → Templates and create a new template. Add items from the catalog — each item maps to a standard definition. For finance, add revenue and cost lines. For performance, add KPIs. For capacity, add roles.

### Assigning a Template to an Engagement

Open an engagement and assign the appropriate templates. You can assign one template per domain (finance, performance, capacity) per engagement.

### Setting Monthly Targets

After assigning templates, set target values per item per month. These can be set in bulk for the entire period or adjusted month by month.

### Recording Monthly Actuals During Check-in

Each month, enter actual values in the Operations → Check-in tab. The grid shows plan vs. actual side by side, with variance calculated automatically.

## The Same Pattern Across All Three Domains

### Finance: Track Revenue and Costs

Planned revenue and cost line items per month. Actual values entered during check-in. Variance = actual − planned. Margins derived from revenue minus costs.

### Performance: Track KPIs and SLA Compliance

Target KPI values set per month. Actual values entered during check-in. RAG status based on thresholds. Breach detection if contract SLA terms are defined.

### Capacity: Track Hours and Utilisation

Planned hours per role per month. Actual hours entered during check-in. FTE and utilisation calculated automatically. Labour costs generated in finance.
