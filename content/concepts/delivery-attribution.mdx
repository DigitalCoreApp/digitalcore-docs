# Delivery Attribution

## What is Delivery Attribution?

### Tracking Which Party is Responsible for Each Cost or Metric

In many service engagements, costs and responsibilities are shared between multiple parties. Delivery attribution in DigitalCore lets you track which party — customer side or deliverer side — is responsible for each specific cost line, KPI, or capacity allocation.

### Customer Side vs. Deliverer Side

- **Customer (Consumer)** — The organisation receiving and paying for the service
- **Deliverer (Provider)** — The organisation delivering the service (could be your own team or a subcontractor)

## How It Works

### Assign Delivery Parties to an Engagement

Go to the engagement and configure delivery parties. Each party is drawn from your engagement delivery records — typically your organisation (the deliverer) and the customer's organisation (the consumer).

### Set a Default Party When Configuring the Engagement

When configuring the engagement, set a default delivery party. This default applies to all items unless specifically overridden. Most engagements have a single deliverer, making the default sufficient.

### Override for Specific Items or Periods When Needed

For complex engagements, override the delivery party on specific plan or measure entries. For example, in a co-managed service, some cost lines might be attributed to the customer's team and others to your team.

## Use Cases

### Showback: Allocating IT Costs to Consuming Departments

Internal IT shared services can use delivery attribution to show each business unit how much of the service cost they're consuming. This powers chargeback and showback reporting.

### Multi-Vendor: Splitting Costs Across Delivery Partners

When multiple vendors deliver parts of a service, attribute costs and metrics to each vendor. This enables accurate vendor performance comparison and cost management.

### Internal: Tracking Shared Service Centre Economics

Shared service centres can track the economics of services delivered to internal business units, with each unit tracked as a delivery party for accurate cost allocation.

## Attribution in Reports

### Filtering by Delivery Party

Dashboards and reports can be filtered by delivery party, showing only the costs, metrics, and hours attributed to a specific customer or deliverer.

### Aggregating Across Engagements by Party

Cross-engagement reporting aggregates by delivery party: "What is the total cost attributed to Acme Corp across all engagements?" This enables customer-level profitability analysis.
