# Automated Cost and Penalty Calculations

## What Happens Automatically?

### Why Automation Matters for Service Economics

Manual cross-referencing between capacity data, rate cards, and finance sheets is a primary source of errors in service organisations. Automation eliminates this by linking data entry directly to financial outcomes.

### Two Key Automations

DigitalCore has two automated cross-domain calculations that trigger as you enter check-in data:

1. **Hours → Labour Costs** (Capacity domain feeds Finance domain)
2. **KPI Breaches → SLA Penalties** (Performance domain feeds Finance domain)

## Hours Become Labour Costs

### When You Log Capacity Hours, DigitalCore Calculates the Cost

Enter actual hours for a role on an engagement. DigitalCore immediately multiplies those hours by the applicable hourly rate and creates a cost entry in the finance domain.

### How It Picks the Right Rate

The system uses a priority hierarchy to find the most specific rate:

1. **Contract rate with engagement match** — Rate specific to this engagement's contract
2. **Contract rate** — General rate defined in the linked contract
3. **Rate card default** — Organisation-level default rate for this role
4. **Any matching rate card** — Fallback if no default is specifically flagged

The most specific rate always wins.

### Where the Cost Appears in Your Finance View

The labour cost appears as an entry in the finance grid, in the line item that matches the role's catalog link (typically a COGS Labour line). It's clearly marked as system-generated so you can distinguish it from manual entries.

## SLA Breaches Become Financial Penalties

### When a KPI Falls Below the Agreed Threshold

If you enter a KPI actual that breaches the SLA threshold defined in the engagement's linked contract, DigitalCore detects the breach automatically.

### How DigitalCore Determines If It's a Breach

The breach check uses the SLA operator defined in the contract terms:

- "Greater than" — Actual exceeds the threshold (e.g., response time > 4 hours)
- "Less than" — Actual falls below the threshold (e.g., availability < 99.5%)

### Penalty Calculation: Fixed Amount, Percentage, or Tiered

The contract defines how the penalty is calculated:

- **Fixed amount** — A flat penalty per breach (e.g., €5,000)
- **Percentage** — A percentage of contract value (e.g., 2% of monthly contract value)
- **Tiered** — Different penalty amounts depending on the severity of the breach

### Where the Penalty Appears in Your Finance View

The penalty creates a cost entry in the finance domain, in the line item linked to the SLA term. It's marked as system-generated with a reference to the specific penalty event.

## Traceability

### Every Auto-Generated Cost is Clearly Labelled

Automated entries are tagged with their source: "Generated from capacity hours" or "Generated from SLA breach." You can trace any automated cost back to the original data that triggered it.

### Manual Entries vs. Automated Entries — Easy to Tell Apart

The finance grid distinguishes manual entries (entered by a user during check-in) from automated entries (generated by triggers). Both contribute to totals and margins equally.
