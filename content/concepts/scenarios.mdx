# Scenario Intelligence

## What is Scenario Intelligence?

### What-If Modelling for Service Economics

Scenario Intelligence lets you model potential changes — pricing adjustments, staffing changes, contract renegotiations — and see their projected financial impact before committing to them.

### How Scenarios Differ from Budgets and Forecasts

A budget is a fixed plan. A forecast is a single revision. A scenario is an explorable option: "What happens if we add 2 FTEs?" "What if revenue drops 15%?" Scenarios let you compare multiple options side by side before deciding which one becomes your plan.

## How Scenarios Work

### Scenarios Model Changes Without Affecting Live Data

A scenario is a sandbox. When you create one, your current plan data is used as the baseline. Drivers (changes) are applied hypothetically — they don't touch your live plan until you explicitly commit.

### Common Scenario Types

- **Reforecast** — Adjusting plans based on emerging actuals
- **Risk Response** — Modelling mitigation strategies for identified risks
- **Growth** — Projecting the impact of winning new business or expanding
- **Cost Reduction** — Evaluating the impact of cutting costs or roles

### Scope: Apply to a Single Engagement or Across a Portfolio

Scenarios can target a single engagement or span multiple engagements for portfolio-level decision-making.

## How Drivers Work

### Percentage Changes

"Increase Revenue by 10%" — applies a percentage multiplier to planned values. Useful for modelling growth or contraction.

### Absolute Changes

"Add 2 FTEs" — adds a fixed amount to the current plan. Useful for modelling specific resource additions or reductions.

### Fixed Values

"Set availability target to 99.9%" — replaces the planned value with a specific number. Useful for modelling contract renegotiations.

## Scenario Lifecycle

### Create → Evaluate → Compare → Commit → Track Accuracy

1. **Create** — Build a scenario with drivers applied to your current plan
2. **Evaluate** — Review projected values and financial impact
3. **Compare** — Place multiple scenarios side by side to see trade-offs
4. **Commit** — Adopt the chosen scenario as your new plan
5. **Track Accuracy** — Later, compare what the scenario predicted vs. what actually happened

### What "Commit" Means — Adopting the Plan

Committing a scenario writes its projected values into your live plan. Your old plan values are preserved for historical comparison.

### Reversing a Commit

Committed scenarios can be undone. Reversing restores the previous plan values.

### Later: Checking How Accurate the Prediction Was

After actuals are recorded, you can review a committed scenario's accuracy: how close were the projections to what actually happened?

## AI-Powered Scenario Generation

### Ask DigitalCore to Generate Options Based on Your Data

Instead of manually building scenarios, ask the AI to generate multiple options. Describe the situation — "margins are dropping, what can we do?" — and DigitalCore creates several scenario variants with different approaches.

### Review Multiple AI-Suggested Approaches

The AI generates 2-4 distinct options — for example, a conservative cost-cutting scenario, an aggressive growth scenario, and a balanced approach. Each comes with projected financial impact.

### Refine Through Conversation

Adjust AI-generated scenarios through natural language: "Make the cost reduction more aggressive" or "Add a revenue increase to option B."
