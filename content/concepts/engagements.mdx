# The Engagement-Centric Model

## What is an Engagement?

### A Service Instance Between Two Parties

An engagement represents a specific service being delivered to a specific customer over a defined period. If you run a "Managed IT Support" service, each customer contract is a separate engagement — "Managed IT Support for Acme Corp — 2025."

Engagements are the fundamental unit of tracking in DigitalCore. All financial data, performance metrics, and capacity allocations attach to engagements.

### How Engagements Relate to Services, Contracts, and Portfolios

- **Services** are the parent — an engagement always belongs to exactly one service
- **Contracts** are the commercial wrapper — an engagement can be linked to a contract that defines rates and SLA terms
- **Portfolios** are groupings — services (and their engagements) can be organised into portfolios for strategic views

## The Entity Hierarchy

### Organisation → Service → Engagement → Data Tracking

The hierarchy is straightforward:

1. **Organisation** — Your company. All data belongs to one organisation and is isolated from others.
2. **Service** — A type of offering you deliver (e.g., "Cloud Hosting," "Brand Consulting")
3. **Engagement** — A specific delivery of that service (e.g., "Cloud Hosting for Contoso FY2025")
4. **Data** — Finance plans/actuals, performance KPIs, capacity hours — all at the engagement level

### Portfolios as Cross-Cutting Groups

Portfolios group services across natural organisational lines. You might have a "Key Accounts" portfolio spanning multiple service types, or a "Government" portfolio grouping all public sector work.

### Contracts as Commercial Wrappers

Contracts define the commercial terms for one or more engagements: contract value, type (fixed-fee, T&M), dates, rate overrides, and SLA terms with penalty definitions.

## Engagement Lifecycle

### Statuses: Draft → Active → On Hold → Completed → Archived

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Draft** | Set up in progress. Not yet accepting check-in data. |
| **Active** | Live and accepting monthly check-ins. |
| **On Hold** | Temporarily paused. Data preserved but no new check-ins expected. |
| **Completed** | Service delivery finished. Historical data preserved for reporting. |
| **Archived** | Removed from active views. Still accessible for historical queries. |

### What Happens at Each Stage

- **Draft → Active**: Templates must be assigned before activating. Once active, the engagement appears in the Operations workspace for check-ins.
- **Active → On Hold**: Health scores stop decaying for data freshness. Check-ins can resume when re-activated.
- **Active/On Hold → Completed**: Final check-in should be entered. Engagement moves to historical views.
- **Completed → Archived**: Engagement is hidden from standard lists but remains in the database for reporting and analytics.

## Delivery Attribution

### Customer Party vs. Deliverer Party

Each engagement can track two types of parties:

- **Customer (Consumer)** — The organisation receiving the service
- **Deliverer (Provider)** — The organisation delivering the service

### Tracking Who Is Responsible for Each Cost or Metric

Delivery parties are assigned at the engagement level and can be overridden per item or per period. This enables granular tracking: "Who is responsible for this cost line?" or "Which delivery partner owns this KPI?"

### Multi-Party Engagements

For complex engagements involving multiple delivery partners, each can be assigned as a separate delivery party. Costs and metrics can be attributed to specific partners, enabling showback and multi-vendor management.
