## What the AI Can Do

### 7 Capabilities That Follow the Management Workflow

DigitalCore's AI is organised around the natural workflow of service management. Rather than a generic chatbot, it provides seven specific capabilities — each designed for a distinct step in the management cycle.

### Monitor → Record → Diagnose → Plan → Decide → Learn → Communicate

| Capability | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Monitor** | Get health snapshots for portfolios and engagements |
| **Record** | Log hours, finance actuals, and KPI values via natural language |
| **Diagnose** | Generate showback reports and variance analysis |
| **Plan** | Create and refine what-if scenarios |
| **Decide** | Compare scenarios and commit to plans |
| **Learn** | Explore KPI definitions, playbooks, and benchmarks |
| **Communicate** | Generate period summaries and executive reports |

## Monitor — Health Snapshots

### Get an Instant Overview of Portfolio or Engagement Health

Ask the AI to check the health of your portfolio or a specific engagement. It returns the current health score, domain breakdowns, top concerns, trend direction, and anomalies — without navigating through multiple screens.

---

## Record — Enter Data via Natural Language

### Log Hours, Finance Actuals, or KPI Values by Asking

Instead of navigating to the check-in grid, tell the AI: "Record 160 hours for Senior Consultant on the Acme engagement for January." The AI validates the input, confirms with you, and records the data.

### Automated Cost and Penalty Calculations Still Apply

Data entered via AI goes through the same automation triggers as data entered through the UI. Hours still generate labour costs. KPI values still trigger breach detection.

---

## Diagnose — Understand What's Happening

### Showback Reports: See How IT Costs Allocate to Departments

Ask the AI to generate a showback report for a specific period. It breaks down costs by delivery party, showing which department or customer carries which portion of the costs.

---

## Plan — Model What-If Scenarios

### Ask AI to Generate Scenario Options from Your Data

Describe your situation: "Margins on the Contoso engagement are declining. What are my options?" The AI analyses the data and generates 2-4 scenario variants with projected financial impact.

### Create and Adjust Scenarios via Conversation

Refine scenarios through natural dialogue: "Make the cost reduction more aggressive" or "What if we also increased the price by 5%?"

---

## Decide — Compare and Commit

### Compare Scenarios Side-by-Side

Ask the AI to compare two or more scenarios. It presents the key differences: projected margin change, capacity impact, risk factors.

### Commit a Scenario to Adopt the Plan

When you've decided, tell the AI to commit the chosen scenario. It writes the projected values into your live plan.

---

## Learn — Education and Playbooks

### Explore Metrics with Formulas and Benchmarks

Ask the AI about any KPI: "What is First Call Resolution? How do I calculate it? What's a good target?" It returns the definition, formula, benchmarks by industry, and tips for improvement.

### Browse 29 Service Management Playbooks

Ask for a playbook by topic: "Show me the playbook for renewal risk" or "What playbooks do you have for capacity planning?" See all playbooks at [digitalcore.app/learn/playbooks](https://digitalcore.app/learn/playbooks).

### Run a Quick Service Reality Check

Provide basic numbers (revenue, costs, FTEs, SLA achievement) and the AI calculates a health score with commentary — no account needed.

---

## Communicate — Generate Reports

### Period Summaries Tailored to Different Audiences

Generate a narrative summary for a specific period and audience: "Summarise Q4 for the Acme engagement, written for an executive audience." The AI produces a structured summary with key highlights, concerns, and recommendations.

### Executive Summary Generation

Create multi-section reports covering multiple engagements. The AI drafts each section with data-backed analysis, health indicators, and recommended actions. Edit, finalize, and export as PDF.
