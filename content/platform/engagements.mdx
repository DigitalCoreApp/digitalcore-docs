# How do I manage engagements?

Engagements are the core unit of work in DigitalCore — each represents a contract or project delivered to a client.

## How do I view my engagements?

Navigate to **Engagements** in the sidebar to see:
- Active engagements
- Pipeline (not yet started)
- Completed engagements
- All engagements list

## What information is tracked?

Each engagement includes:

- **Client & Contract** — who and what value
- **Timeline** — start/end dates, milestones
- **Team** — assigned resources
- **Financials** — revenue, costs, margin
- **Status** — health indicators

## How do I update an engagement?

1. Click the engagement to open it
2. Edit fields as needed
3. Changes save automatically

Key actions:
- **Add team members** — Team tab
- **Log expenses** — Financials tab
- **Update status** — Overview tab

## How do I close an engagement?

1. Ensure all time is logged
2. Reconcile financials
3. Set status to "Completed"
4. Optionally archive

Closed engagements remain in reports and analytics.
