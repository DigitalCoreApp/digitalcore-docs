# Dashboard

The Dashboard is the first screen you see after logging in — your home base for monitoring portfolio health and taking action.

## Welcome Hero and Onboarding Checklist

New users see a **Welcome Hero** panel with an onboarding checklist guiding them through initial setup:

1. Create your first service
2. Set up an engagement
3. Assign templates
4. Run your first check-in

Each step links directly to the relevant page. Once all steps are complete (or dismissed), the hero panel hides and the full dashboard takes over.

## Quick Stats

Three key numbers across the top of the dashboard:

| Stat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Active Services** | Total services your organisation is currently managing |
| **Due This Week** | Number of check-ins that should be completed this week |
| **Overdue** | Check-ins that are past due and need attention |

These stats update in real time as you work.

## Dashboard Cards

### Attention Required

The most actionable card on the dashboard. Shows items that need your attention right now:

- Overdue check-ins
- Engagements with declining health
- Recent SLA breaches
- Upcoming contract renewals

Each item links directly to the relevant engagement or action.

### Portfolio Health

A summary card showing the overall health score (0-100) for your entire portfolio, with sub-scores for Finance, Performance, and Capacity domains. The RAG indicator (Green/Amber/Red) gives an instant visual read on portfolio status.
