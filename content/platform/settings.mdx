## API Keys Tab

### Generating an API Key

Generate API keys for programmatic access to DigitalCore — primarily for the Paid MCP server.

Each key has:

- Name
- Permissions scope
- Expiration date

### Key Permissions

Keys can be scoped to specific capabilities:

| Scope | Access Level |
|-------|--------------|
| **Read-only** | View data only |
| **Read-write** | View and modify data |
| **Admin** | Full access |

Use the minimum permissions needed for each integration.

### Key Expiration

All keys have an expiration date. Expired keys stop working automatically. Set expiration based on your security policy — **90 days is recommended**.

### Revoking Keys

Revoke a key at any time from the API Keys tab. Revoked keys stop working immediately. The revocation is logged for audit purposes.
