## Getting Started with Catalogs

### Generate Standard Defaults

New organisations can generate a standard set of catalog entries with one click. This populates:

- Common P&L categories
- Standard KPIs
- Typical roles
- Default AI use cases

This gives you a working starting point to customise.

## Adding and Editing Catalog Entries

- Add new entries to any catalog at any time
- Edit existing entries — changes do not retroactively affect templates or engagements that already reference them
- Catalog entries can be deactivated but not deleted if they're in use
