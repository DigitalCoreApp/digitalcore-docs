# How do I configure my organisation?

The Organisation module defines your company structure for accurate cost allocation and reporting.

## What can I configure?

- **Organizational Units** — departments, divisions, teams
- **Roles** — job functions with default rates
- **Locations** — offices, remote designations
- **Cost Centers** — for overhead allocation
- **Skills** — competencies for resource matching

## How do I set up org units?

1. Navigate to **Organisation** in the sidebar
2. Click **+ Add Unit**
3. Enter unit name and parent (if nested)
4. Assign a manager
5. Save

## How do roles work?

Roles define:
- Default internal cost rate
- Default bill rate
- Utilization target
- Typical responsibilities

Team members are assigned to roles. When they log time, their role's cost rate applies.

## How do I manage cost centers?

Cost centers group indirect costs for allocation:

1. Create cost centers (e.g., "IT", "Facilities", "Admin")
2. Assign overhead costs to cost centers
3. Configure allocation rules
4. DigitalCore distributes costs to engagements
