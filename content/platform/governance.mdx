# How does governance work?

DigitalCore's Governance module manages approvals, escalations, and decision tracking for service delivery.

## What governance features are available?

- **Approval Workflows** — route decisions for sign-off
- **Escalation Rules** — automatic escalation when thresholds breach
- **Decision Log** — audit trail of choices and rationale
- **Risk Register** — track and mitigate risks

## How do I set up approval workflows?

1. Navigate to **Governance → Workflows**
2. Click **+ New Workflow**
3. Define trigger conditions
4. Add approval steps and approvers
5. Set timeout and escalation rules
6. Activate the workflow

## What triggers escalation?

Configure automatic escalation for:

- Margin falling below threshold
- Budget variance exceeding limit
- Missed milestones
- KPI breaches

Escalations notify designated managers via email and in-app alerts.

## How do I track decisions?

The Decision Log captures:
- What decision was made
- Who made it and when
- Supporting data/rationale
- Impact on engagement

Access via **Governance → Decision Log**.
