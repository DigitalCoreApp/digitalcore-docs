# How do I track financial performance?

DigitalCore's Finance module tracks service-level P&L with automatic capacity-to-finance cost calculation.

## How are margins calculated?

DigitalCore calculates engagement margins using:

```
Gross Margin = Revenue - Direct Costs
Margin % = (Gross Margin / Revenue) × 100
```

**Direct costs** include:
- Labor costs (hours × internal cost rate)
- Direct expenses (travel, materials, subcontractors)

## What P&L categories does DigitalCore use?

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Revenue** | Contract value, recognized based on billing model |
| **Labor Cost** | Team hours × internal cost rates |
| **Direct Expenses** | Non-labor costs allocated to engagement |
| **Gross Margin** | Revenue minus all direct costs |
| **Overhead Allocation** | Optional: allocated indirect costs |
| **Net Margin** | Gross margin minus overhead |

## How does automatic labor costing work?

1. Team member logs hours to an engagement
2. DigitalCore multiplies hours by their internal cost rate
3. Cost flows automatically to the engagement P&L
4. Margin updates in real-time

No manual journal entries required.

## How do I view financial reports?

Navigate to **Finance** in the sidebar to access:

- **Engagement P&L** — per-engagement profitability
- **Portfolio Summary** — cross-engagement financials
- **Trend Analysis** — margin trends over time
- **Variance Reports** — budget vs. actual
