# Decisions

The Decisions workspace provides a structured framework for making and tracking governance decisions.

---

## Governance Cases List

The Decisions workspace lists all governance cases with:

- Status
- Linked engagements
- Creation date
- Decision owner

Filter by status: **Open**, **In Progress**, **Decided**, **Closed**.

---

## The Decision Framework

Each governance case follows a structured four-step process:

### Step 1: Situation

Describe what's happening and why a decision is needed. Link to relevant engagements and include supporting data — health scores, variance reports, or trend observations.

### Step 2: Options & Analysis (Scenarios)

Attach scenarios to the governance case. Each scenario represents a potential course of action with projected financial and operational impacts. Use the AI to generate options or create them manually.

### Step 3: Decision

Record the chosen option, who decided, and the rationale. This becomes part of the permanent audit trail.

### Step 4: Next Steps

Define action items with owners, due dates, and descriptions. Track risks and issues that may arise during implementation.
