# Strategy Workspace

The Strategy workspace provides leadership-level visibility and connects organisational objectives to operational delivery.

---

## Cockpit Tab

The Strategy Cockpit provides leadership-level visibility across the entire portfolio. It aggregates financial performance, health scores, and capacity utilisation into a single strategic view.

Key metrics include:

- Total revenue
- Total margin
- Average health score
- FTE count
- Trend direction over time

---

## OKRs Tab

### Objectives List

View all organisational objectives with their status, progress percentage, owner, and target date. Filter by status (Active, Completed, At Risk) or search by keyword.

### Key Results

Each objective expands to show its key results — measurable outcomes linked to specific engagements. Key results display:

- Current value vs. target
- Progress bar
- Contributing engagements

---

## AI Initiatives Tab

Track AI adoption across your organisation:

- View which engagements have AI use cases assigned
- See the types of AI capabilities deployed
- Monitor aggregate adoption metrics

The AI Use Case Catalog defines the standard initiative types tracked here.
