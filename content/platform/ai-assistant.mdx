# How do I use the AI Assistant?

DigitalCore is AI-native — built from the ground up for AI agents to analyze service economics and propose recommendations.

## What can the AI Assistant do?

- **Detect variances** — spots margin erosion, budget overruns, delivery risks
- **Propose scenarios** — suggests pricing, staffing, or scope changes
- **Answer questions** — natural language queries about your data
- **Execute playbooks** — follows proven service management frameworks

## How does "AI proposes, humans decide" work?

DigitalCore follows a human-in-the-loop model:

1. AI analyzes data and detects an issue
2. AI generates 2-3 scenario options with projected impact
3. Human reviews and selects preferred option (or modifies)
4. AI implements the chosen action
5. Decision is logged for audit

You stay in control. AI accelerates analysis, not decisions.

## How do I access AI features?

- **AI Insights** panel on dashboards — proactive recommendations
- **Ask AI** button — natural language questions
- **Scenario Modeler** — AI-assisted what-if analysis
- **MCP integration** — use via Claude, Cursor, VS Code

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) lets AI agents connect directly to DigitalCore. Get explanations, run queries, and access playbooks from your IDE.
