# System: Roles & Administration

Role definitions and organisation-level settings.

## App Roles

### Role Definitions

DigitalCore uses four roles to control access:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Full access: user management, organisation settings, all configuration, all data |
| **Manager** | Manage services, engagements, contracts, templates, decisions, and reports. Cannot manage users or organisation settings. |
| **Operator** | Enter data (check-ins, hours, actuals), view dashboards and reports. Cannot create or modify configuration. |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to dashboards, reports, and engagement data. Cannot enter or modify data. |

### What Each Role Can Do

Access is enforced throughout the application — navigation items, action buttons, and data entry fields are shown or hidden based on the user's role.

Examples:

- **Operators** see the check-in grids but not the template configuration pages
- **Viewers** see dashboards and reports but cannot edit anything

### Organisation-Level Settings

Admins access organisation settings from the System menu:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Organisation Name** | Your organisation's display name |
| **Default Currency** | Currency used for financial values |
| **Fiscal Year Start** | Month your fiscal year begins |
| **Other Preferences** | Global settings affecting all users |

These settings affect all users in the organisation.
