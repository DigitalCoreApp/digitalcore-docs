Track service level agreements and key performance indicators across your portfolio.

## What metrics does DigitalCore track?

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **On-Time Delivery** | % of milestones delivered on schedule |
| **Budget Variance** | Actual vs. planned costs |
| **Quality Score** | Based on defects, rework, client feedback |
| **Utilization** | Team billable efficiency |
| **Client Satisfaction** | NPS or custom scoring |

## How do I set up KPI tracking?

1. Navigate to **Performance** in the sidebar
2. Click **Configure KPIs**
3. Select metrics to track
4. Set targets and thresholds
5. Save configuration

## How do alerts work?

DigitalCore alerts you when:
- KPIs breach threshold (e.g., margin < 30%)
- SLA deadlines approach
- Trends indicate future problems

Configure alerts in **Settings → Notifications**.

## How do I view performance dashboards?

The Performance module includes:

- **Portfolio Scorecard** — aggregate KPIs
- **Engagement Health** — per-engagement status
- **Trend Charts** — performance over time
