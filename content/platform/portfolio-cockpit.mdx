# How do I use the Portfolio Cockpit?

The Portfolio Cockpit provides a unified view of all your service engagements in one dashboard.

## What does the cockpit show?

- **Portfolio Health Score** — aggregate health across all engagements
- **Financial Summary** — total revenue, margin, variance
- **Engagement Cards** — status of each engagement
- **Alerts** — issues requiring attention
- **Trends** — performance over time

## How do I read the health score?

The health score (0-100) aggregates:

| Factor | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Margin vs. target | 30% |
| Schedule adherence | 25% |
| Budget variance | 25% |
| Risk level | 20% |

**Green (80-100)**: On track  
**Yellow (50-79)**: Needs attention  
**Red (0-49)**: Intervention required

## How do I drill down?

Click any engagement card to see:
- Detailed P&L
- Team allocation
- Timeline/milestones
- Risks and issues

## How do I customize the view?

- **Filter** by client, status, manager, or date range
- **Sort** by margin, revenue, health score
- **Group** by client, service type, or team
