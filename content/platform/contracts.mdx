# How do I manage contracts?

Contracts define the commercial terms of your client engagements.

## What contract details are tracked?

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Contract Value** | Total amount |
| **Billing Type** | Fixed-fee, T&M, subscription, hybrid |
| **Payment Terms** | Net 30, milestones, etc. |
| **Start/End Date** | Contract period |
| **Renewal Terms** | Auto-renew, notice period |
| **Rate Card** | Applicable billing rates |

## How do I create a contract?

Contracts are created as part of engagement setup:

1. Create new engagement
2. In the Contract section, enter terms
3. Upload contract document (optional)
4. Save

## How does billing work?

DigitalCore generates billing based on contract type:

- **Fixed-fee**: Bill on milestones or schedule
- **T&M**: Bill based on logged hours × rates
- **Subscription**: Recurring billing

## How do I track renewals?

The Contracts view shows:
- Upcoming renewals (next 90 days)
- Expiring contracts
- Renewal rate by client

Set alerts for renewal dates in **Settings → Notifications**.
