# Operations Workspace

The Operations workspace is where you manage engagements and run check-ins to record actuals against plans.

The Operations workspace shows all engagements your organisation manages. Use the search bar to find engagements by name, or filter by service, status, or health score.

The list displays key information at a glance:

- Engagement name
- Service
- Status indicator
- Health score
- Last check-in date

## Engagement Workspace Tabs

Click into an engagement to open the workspace, which is organised into tabs:

### Pulse Tab — Health Snapshot

The Pulse tab shows the engagement's current health score with:

- Domain breakdowns (Finance, Performance, Capacity)
- Trend direction
- Top concerns
- Timeline of key events

### Check-in Tab — Data Entry

The Check-in tab is where you enter monthly data. It contains three sub-tabs:

| Sub-Tab | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Finance** | Revenue, costs, and P&L line items |
| **Performance** | KPI measurements and SLA tracking |
| **Capacity** | Hours worked by role |

Each sub-tab shows a multi-period grid with planned values and actual input fields. See the [Monthly Check-in Guide](/docs/guides/monthly-checkin) for the detailed workflow.

### Timeline Tab — Deliverables, Milestones, Governance

The Timeline tab shows the chronological view of everything that has happened on this engagement:

- Milestones
- Deliverables
- Governance decisions
- Check-in events
- Scenario commits

For project-based engagements, this is where you track workstreams, milestones, and deliverables.
