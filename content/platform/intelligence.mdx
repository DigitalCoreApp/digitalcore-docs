## Summary Editor

### Section Types

The editor presents sections based on the chosen template:

- **Financial Snapshot** — Revenue, costs, margins, variance
- **KPI Overview** — Performance metrics with RAG status
- **Team Utilisation** — Capacity hours and FTE allocation
- **Highlights** — Notable achievements or milestones
- **Risks & Issues** — Items needing attention
- **Recommendations** — Suggested actions

Each section has a header, data table (where applicable), and a narrative area.

### Health Banner

The summary header displays a health banner based on the engagement's current health score:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Healthy** (green) | Engagement on track |
| **At Risk** (amber) | Some concerns |
| **Critical** (red) | Significant issues |

### AI Narrative Generation

Click the AI button on any section to generate narrative text. The AI analyses the underlying data and produces a clear, audience-appropriate summary.

Select the target audience before generating:

| Audience | Style |
|----------|-------|
| **Internal** | Candid, includes internal metrics, references team names |
| **Customer** | Professional, focuses on service delivery and SLA compliance |
| **Executive** | High-level, emphasises strategic implications and decisions needed |
| **Board** | Condensed, focuses on financials and risk |

Use **Regenerate All** to refresh every section at once.

### Finalise and Download PDF

When the summary is ready, click **Finalise** to lock it (preventing further edits) and record the finalised date. Export as PDF for distribution.
