# How do I plan capacity?

DigitalCore's Capacity Planning module helps you forecast team availability and allocate resources effectively.

## What is capacity planning?

Capacity planning answers:
- Do we have enough people for upcoming work?
- Who is over/under-utilized?
- When should we hire or reassign?

## How do I view team capacity?

Navigate to **Capacity** in the sidebar to see:

- **Utilization Dashboard** — billable vs. available hours
- **Resource Calendar** — team availability over time
- **Demand Forecast** — expected work from active engagements

## How is utilization calculated?

```
Utilization % = (Billable Hours / Available Hours) × 100
```

- **Billable Hours**: Time logged to client engagements
- **Available Hours**: Working hours minus PTO, holidays, admin time

## How do I forecast demand?

DigitalCore forecasts demand based on:

1. Active engagement timelines
2. Planned hours per role
3. Historical delivery patterns

Compare demand against available capacity to spot gaps.

## How do I optimize allocation?

The AI assistant suggests:
- Reassigning underutilized team members
- Adjusting engagement timelines
- Identifying hiring needs
