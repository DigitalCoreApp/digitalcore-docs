# How do I manage services?

Services represent the types of work your organization delivers to clients.

## What is a service?

A service is a repeatable offering, such as:
- Cloud Migration
- Managed Security Operations
- Application Development
- IT Support

Engagements are instances of services delivered to specific clients.

## How do I create a service?

1. Navigate to **Services** in the sidebar
2. Click **+ New Service**
3. Define service name and description
4. Set default pricing model
5. Configure standard deliverables
6. Save

## What can I configure?

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Pricing Model** | Fixed-fee, T&M, subscription |
| **Standard Margin Target** | Expected margin % |
| **Typical Duration** | Default engagement length |
| **Required Roles** | Roles needed to deliver |
| **Deliverables** | Standard outputs |

## How do services help?

- **Benchmarking** — compare engagement margins against service averages
- **Pricing** — use historical data to price new work
- **Staffing** — know which roles are typically needed
- **Reporting** — analyze profitability by service line
